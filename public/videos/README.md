   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
   - File size: Keep under 10MB for fast loading
   - Content: Real estate plots, properties, aerial views, etc.

3. **Add Your Video**:
   - Name your video file: `real-estate-background.mp4`
   - Place it in this folder: `public/videos/`
   - The video will automatically play on the homepage

4. **Optimize Your Video** (Optional):
   - Use online tools like:
     - HandBrake (free desktop app)
     - CloudConvert (online converter)

## Alternative: Use a Placeholder

If you don't have a video yet, the homepage will still look great with the animated gradient background and floating shapes.
